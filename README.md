Report: Solana Smart Contract Upgrade &amp; Audit for Gaming Protocol (PrimeSkill Studio) – Superteam Earn

# Audit Report – Wagering Smart Contract (Solana)

---

## 📌 Executive Summary
This audit focused on detecting **security vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and performance/compute inefficiencies** in the `wager-program`.  

The program allows creation of game sessions, player joins, wagers, and distribution or refund of funds.  
Since the program handles **real funds during live matches**, security and correctness are critical.

## 🚨 Findings Overview

| Severity | Issue                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High** | Missing strict authority checks in `distribute/refund` flows          |
| **High** | Race condition: double-spend risk (no atomic finalization flag)       |
| **High** | Vault account assumptions: missing mint/owner validation              |
| **Medium** | Token account validation insufficient                              |
| **Medium** | Division errors (divide-by-zero, unfair remainder handling)         |
| **Medium** | Game server authority not strongly bound (no multisig option)       |
| **Medium** | Weak CPI error handling, risk of inconsistent state                 |
| **Low**  | Integer overflow risk on `u16` counters                               |
| **Low**  | Inefficient Vec allocations (e.g. `get_all_players`)                  |
| **Low**  | Excessive `msg!` logging leaks information                            |

## 🔧 Recommendations

### High Priority
- Add **atomic finalization flag** (enum `{ Open, Finalized }`) to prevent double payouts/refunds.
- Enforce vault accounts as `Account<'info, TokenAccount>` and validate mint/owner strictly.
- Ensure all transfers use **PDA authority** with `invoke_signed`.

### Medium Priority
- Prevent divide-by-zero; handle remainder tokens deterministically.
- Improve CPI error handling — mark session finalized **only if all transfers succeed**.
- Restrict `game_server` authority (consider multisig or tighter binding).

### Low Priority / Optimizations
- Use `u64` for token amounts; add overflow checks for small counters.
- Avoid large on-chain Vec copies; track counters instead.
- Replace `msg!` logs with **Anchor events** for better off-chain parsing.

## 🧪 Suggested Test Cases
1. **Session creation** (happy path).  
2. **Join user** — enforce max capacity, reject overflow joins.  
3. **Distribute winnings** — enforce authority-only execution.  
4. **Refund vs distribute race** — simulate; only one path succeeds.  
5. **Division edge cases** — division by zero, remainder handling.  
6. **Invalid token accounts** — vault/mint mismatch must fail.  
7. **Overflow checks** — prevent `u16` counter overflow.
